# Open satellite demo data

This folder is reserved for example IQ clips and configuration files for satellites that explicitly allow public or amateur reception.

Guidance:

- Only place data here if the satellite operator clearly permits public reception and community decoding.
- Document the source, licence, and any usage constraints in this file.
- If in doubt, use synthetic data instead of real RF captures.

At repo creation time, this folder is empty on purpose.
