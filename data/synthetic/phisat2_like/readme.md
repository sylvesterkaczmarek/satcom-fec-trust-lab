# Synthetic Φsat-2 like waveforms

This folder contains synthetic IQ snippets that mimic a small EO link similar to Φsat-2, based on public information about typical modulation and coding schemes.

- These files are simulated, not recordings from real missions.
- They are safe to redistribute and exist purely for demonstration and testing.
- If you ever replace them with mission data, you must obtain explicit written permission and update this note accordingly.
