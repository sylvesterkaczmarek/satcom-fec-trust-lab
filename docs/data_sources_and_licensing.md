# Data sources and licensing

This project is designed to stay clean from a legal and ethical perspective.

## Live signals

- Live reception is limited to satellites whose operators clearly permit public or amateur reception.  
- Typical examples include some educational or amateur satellites in VHF / UHF bands.  
- Users are responsible for checking the terms for any satellite they choose to receive.

The repository does not ship RF captures from missions that do not explicitly allow redistribution.

## Synthetic IQ

- Synthetic IQ files under `data/synthetic/` are generated by helper scripts in `scripts/`.  
- They are purely simulated and carry no licensing constraints beyond the repo licence.

## Mission inspired configurations

- Φsat-2 is treated as a mission class reference.  
- Public information about typical small EO link parameters is used to define “Φsat-2 like” configurations.  
- The repository does not include real Φsat-2 RF or TT&C data.

If, in the future, real mission recordings are added under explicit permission, this document must be updated with the exact terms and source.
